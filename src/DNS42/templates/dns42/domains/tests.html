<p>{blocktrans}This report is generated from all the info from the git DN42 registry. The report gets in sync with the registry every 12 hours. The checks on nameservers or all the nameservers of a domain can be requested manually and will be done in the next 5 or 10 minutes.{/blocktrans}</p>
<p>{blocktrans}If there is a domain with no nameservers, it means one of two things, either there is no IP address for the corresponding nameserver in the registry, or the nameserver is outside the dn42 domain{/blocktrans}</p>
<p>{blocktrans}The tests run are the described next:{/blocktrans}</p>
<h3 id="dns_response">{blocktrans}DNS probe response (DNS Response, for short){/blocktrans}</h3>
<p>{blocktrans}We try to get SOA record for your domain. If the DNS response fails, the other tests are skipped.{/blocktrans}</p>
<h3 id="ns_list">{blocktrans}Returned NS list{/blocktrans}</h3>
<p>{blocktrans}We query the NS records for your domain. We list every nameserver returned by your server, in no particular order.{/blocktrans}</p>
<h3 id="parent_match">{blocktrans}Parent NS match{/blocktrans}</h3>
<p>{blocktrans}The returned nameserver list by your server SHOULD match the nameserver list of the parent zone. If the this test fails, you should check that the list nameservers in the registry are up-to-date.{/blocktrans}</p>
<h3 id="authoritative">{blocktrans}Authoritative response from this NS{/blocktrans}</h3>
<p>{blocktrans}Your nameserver should response in a 'authoritative' way. This means, to have the authoritative flag active in the response. An authoritative DNS Server means that it is the ultimate authority for reporting DNS records for that domain.{/blocktrans}</p>
<h3 id="zone_transfer">{blocktrans}DNS Open Zone Transfer (Full transfer, for short){/blocktrans}</h3>
<p>{blocktrans}That means we asked for the information in your entire DNS zone and your DNS server gave it to us. This is generally considered a security issue as it can reveal host names/sub-domains or other DNS records that you don't want disseminated to the public.{/blocktrans}</p>
